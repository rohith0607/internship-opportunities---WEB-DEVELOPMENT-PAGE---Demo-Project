				<p> I would like to take this opportunity to introduce our internship
experience and say that <b>SUMMER INTERNSHIP</b> is very
dedicated in providing an outstanding learning, educational and fun
experience for all of our interns. The “Internship Experience” is just
that, an experience in which the interns will be challenged and educated
from the beginning of the internship to the completion. The following
is specific information regarding the recreation internship program. This
internship program will be very unique and all students will gain valuable
experience in which will help them understand more about the
hospitality industry. As we are a nationally approved internship site
through RCRA, you can be assured that our program has met some very
high standards and that this program is one of the best!
